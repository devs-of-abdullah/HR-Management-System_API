## Authentication Flow

```
1. POST /api/auth/login
   → returns { accessToken, refreshToken }

2. Use accessToken in Authorization header:
   Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>

3. When accessToken expires → POST /api/auth/refresh
   → returns new { accessToken, refreshToken }

4. POST /api/auth/logout
   → revokes the refreshToken
```

## Authorization

Two levels of access control are used:

**Role-based** — via `[Authorize(Roles = "admin,superAdmin")]`

**Resource-based** — via `UserOwnerOrAdminRequirement`:
- Admins can access any user
- Regular users can only access their own data (matched by JWT `NameIdentifier` claim)
